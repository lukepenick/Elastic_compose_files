# Elastic_compose_files
Elastic docker compose files as well as files for configs

In the docker-compose file, remember you have to run the docker-compose up command from the command line in the directory the file is in.

Also on the left side of the : in the volumes section and the ports section are that of the host machine

You will need to make or change the directories on the left and make sure the files are there that need to be.

If you need help or have questions let me know.
The stable folder is the logstash config files.
